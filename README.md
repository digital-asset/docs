## Provide Feedback on a Docs Page

Every page on docs.canton.network has two feedback buttons in the footer:
- `Suggest edits`
- `Raise issue`

### Suggest edits:
Use this to propose a direct change to the page, fix a typo, update a code sample, improve wording, etc.

**How it works:**

- Click “Suggest edits” in the footer of any page.
- GitHub opens the source file for that exact page.
- Fork the repo, make your edits, and open a Pull Request.
- Canton docs team reviews and merges accepted changes if all checks out.

### Raise Issue:
Use this to report a problem or request new content without editing the source yourself.

**How it works:**

- Click “Raise Issue” in the footer of any page.
- A GitHub Issue opens *Pre-filled* with the Path of the page you were on.
- Describe in detail what's wrong or missing along with the source of information to verify and submit.
- The team reviews it and responds.


## Local Development

### Prerequisites

Either:

- [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/)
- [`nix`](https://nixos.org/download/)

OR:

- [Node.js 24](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (note that `mintlify` is not currently compatible with Node.js 26)
- [Python 3.14](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you are running any of the machinery for syncing snippets or updating generated docs

### Source and published output

Edit the complete documentation corpus in `docs-source/`, including pages,
`docs.json`, snippets, images, scripts, and API specifications. `docs-main/` is
checked-in output and remains Mintlify's deployment directory. Never edit output
directly: generation overwrites it and removes files deleted from source.

```bash
npm run build
npm run validate:network-variable-tabs
```

Commit both trees together. The existing network-variable check now verifies
**every output file**, including ordinary pages and binary assets. It detects
missing, extra, or changed targets without modifying either tree.

When rebasing an existing branch, move its documentation edits and generator
destinations from `docs-main/` to `docs-source/` before rebuilding. Automation
must generate source, run the build, and include both trees in its commit paths.
Validators and previews that read published output continue to use `docs-main/`.
External snippet identifiers and `/snippets/...` imports keep their existing names.

Author network-dependent content inline in a source page:

```mdx
<NetworkVariables>

Scan URL: |gsf_scan_url|

</NetworkVariables>
```

The build expands these blocks to static DevNet, TestNet, and MainNet tabs using
`docs-source/snippets/generated/version-dashboard-data.mdx`. Import snippet
components at the top of the page as usual; imports used inside a block are
inlined before substitution. The previous `snippets/networkvars/` fragments have
been incorporated into their owning source pages. The old `--bootstrap` migration
option is no longer needed.

“Suggest edits” opens the matching file in `docs-source/`. `edit-source.js`
redirects Mintlify's generated GitHub edit links, preserving the selected branch
and filename even when the footer appears after consent or client navigation.

Reference, release-note, dashboard, and snippet generators now write to
`docs-source/`. After running one manually, run `npm run build` and commit both
trees. The generated-docs PR automation performs these steps together.

### Running the dev server

```bash
direnv allow
npm run dev
```

The site will be available at http://localhost:3000.

### Check for broken links

```bash
mintlify broken-links
```

## Generate external snippets

External snippet extraction from source repositories is documented in [config/snippet-config/update-workflows.md](config/snippet-config/update-workflows.md). Use that workflow when updating snippet configs under `config/snippet-config/` or regenerating checked-in snippets under `docs-source/snippets/external/`.

Run this whenever you add, remove, or update a snippet source in `config/snippet-config/`, or when you need to pull in changes from an upstream repo (such as Canton or Splice) that are referenced by existing snippets.

```bash
npm run generate:external-snippets -- --list
npm run generate:external-snippets -- canton --source-dir ../canton
```
